# Conjin Demo

This website contains a demo of a [conjin project](https://github.com/lucques/conjin). The goal is to demonstrate as many features and modules as possible, each as isolated as possible. It therefore serves also as some kind of unit test suite:
- Run `lcd-linkchecker` to check for PHP errors (as well as broken links)
- View the pages to check for visual errors


## Installation
1. Clone the conjin project, e.g. to `repos/conjin`
2. Clone this repository, e.g. to `/repos/conjin-demo`
3. Create the three files containing paths:
    - [./deployments/APP_DIR](./deployments/APP_DIR) (here: `/repos/conjin-demo`)
